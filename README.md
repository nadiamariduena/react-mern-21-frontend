# Let's Begin!

## 1. Install the dependencies

```javascript
// copy and paste the following
npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons   react-router-dom node-sass@4.14.1 styled-components

// npm i styled-components
```

 <br>


### Lets start by creating the pages folder

- create the pages folder
- inside of it, create the Home.jsx

<br>

> Here you can see how the [**emmet extension**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet) auto complete and automatically create the import on top of the file

## Let's Begin!

> **⚠️** Sometimes **styled components** can cause issues, as you cannot see if there is an error when you miss a **semicolon**

<br>
<br>
<br>

# NEWSLETTER 🍯

<br>

### Start by Creating the Newsletter component

- type **rafce** to automatic create the component default

```javascript
import React from "react";

const Newsletter = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>newsletetr</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Newsletter;
```

 <br>

### Now export the component inside the Home.jsx

```javascript
import React from "react";
//
//
//
import Announcement from "../components/Announcement";
import Navbar from "../components/Navbar";
import Slider from "../components/Slider";
import Categories from "../components/Categories";
import Products from "../components/Products";
import Newsletter from "../components/Newsletter";

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Announcement />
      <Navbar />
      <Slider />
      <Categories />
      <Products />
      <Newsletter />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```
