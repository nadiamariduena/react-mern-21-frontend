# üêù

# Let's Begin!

## 1. Install the dependencies

```javascript
// copy and paste the following
npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons   react-router-dom node-sass@4.14.1 styled-components

// npm i styled-components
```

 <br>


### Lets start by creating the pages folder

- create the pages folder
- inside of it, create the Home.jsx

<br>

> Here you can see how the [**emmet extension**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet) auto complete and automatically create the import on top of the file

# _NOVE_ e-boutique

<br>

> **I started this project out of curiosity**, I wanted to see the **advantages & disadvantages** in building an e-commerce app using React, **Commercejs and stripe** and an app build with (Mongodb, Express, React and Nodejs | **MERN**). <br> <br>

<br>
<br>

<br>

## THE MOTIVATION

<br>

- **The main motivator for this project was my curiosity** as well as my desire to expand my knowledge. Due to the disastrous effect **the pandemic had on the small businesses** I used to visit, I decided I wanted to find a way to create websites and e-commerce stores that any business owner could use to represent their wares online, be it small or big. <br><br>
- Although it isn't fully functional yet, as there is a final error I have to correct to publish it on the web, this is the result of my work. <br><br>
- **Aside from that I wasn't entirely satisfied with the design so I customized it** as you can see from the preview shown above.

<br>

- Here you can find my other attempt using: [commercejs | stripe and MUI](https://github.com/nadiamariduena/e-commerce-react-stripe)

## PLAYING AROUND

<br>

- I Created a parallel repository to work on the routes, to have a better preview of the project and also to test the new things i ve been learning lately.

<br>

- This repository contains the original set up (without the routing), that will be used to continue with the part of the tutorial (**the backend**)

# Customizing the original Design

> **I changed all** the original images and design palette for the ones you see on the image below. <br>
> **I also tested** different things that you don't have in the video tutorial, you can find them in my **Notes**
