# üêù

# Let's Begin!

## 1. Install the dependencies

```javascript
// copy and paste the following
npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons   react-router-dom node-sass@4.14.1 styled-components

// npm i styled-components
```

 <br>


### Lets start by creating the pages folder

- create the pages folder
- inside of it, create the Home.jsx

<br>

> Here you can see how the [**emmet extension**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet) auto complete and automatically create the import on top of the file

<!-- - This is the continuation of **responsive** -->

<br>
<br>

> **NOTE:** I started this project out of curiosity, I wanted to see the differences between using this type of e-commerce setup (with **commercejs** and **stripe**) and a shop build with (**Mongodb, Express, React,Nodejs**).

<br>

- Here you can find my other attempt using: [commercejs | stripe and MUI](https://github.com/nadiamariduena/e-commerce-react-stripe)
