### Lets start by creating the pages folder

- create the pages folder
- inside of it, create the Home.jsx

## Let's Begin!

> **For beginners:** Dont forget to add any new component to the Home.jsx and of course import it there. (just check the **Home.jsx** in each branch)

<br>

- **‚ö†Ô∏è** Sometimes **styled components** can cause issues, as you cannot see if there is an error when you miss a **semicolon**
